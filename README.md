The era of AI has significantly enhanced healthcare in all aspects. AI has revolutionized healthcare by enhancing diagnostics, personalizing treatment, improving patient care, and streamlining administrative tasks.

Chronic wounds are injuries that do not heal properly and tend to take an unusually long time to heal, often persisting for more than three months. They can be challenging to treat and may sometimes require specialized care to address the underlying causes and promote healing.

Patients with chronic wounds face difficulties including persistent pain, high infection risk, limited mobility, psychological stress, body image concerns, social isolation, and financial strain. Timely and effective management is crucial to mitigate these complications and improve the patient's quality of life.

Healthcare, on the other hand, is impacted by chronic wounds through increased costs, resource allocation, frequent hospital admissions, extended care needs, challenges in maintaining quality of care, significant research investments, and the potential for severe patient complications.

Artificial Intelligence can enhance both the diagnosis and management of chronic wounds, and my project focuses on this application.
